  By selecting this option you get the possibility to build and test the repository in further environments than the "Priority Environment".
  The below emerging matrix shows all supported combinations of Ubuntu release version and architecture.
  Select the environments you want to use there.
  Note that only the build job will be executed.
  If you want to run the whole pipeline as well for another Ubuntu version/architecture combination, create another instance of this repository (with suffix).<br/>
